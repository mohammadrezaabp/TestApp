# TestApp

Hi.
In this project I have built a basic leave management app using asp.net core 3.1.
When you first create a asp.net core web application and using default authentication of .net 
the data type of id column in AspNetUser table is string and it's a little bit annoying.
So, in this project I have changed all string id's to int for better use.
